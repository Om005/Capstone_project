P2.DA-IICT Placement Manager:
Develop a comprehensive Placement Manager system to streamline the
placement process for the university. This system will record and manage all
placement-related activities for each batch and program, including written tests,
interviews, shortlisting, and job offers. Also, it can search for students placed in a
specific company, batch, location, etc.
